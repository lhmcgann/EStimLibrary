# EStimLibrary
A C# library to facilitate electrical stimulation research and development.

More details coming soon.

## Repo Structure
* `src/` - the library source code
* `tests/` - the test projects
* `models/` - examples of spatial model definition files
* `examples/` - example applications using the library's high-level API
* `docs/` - additional documentation files, including a dictionary and coding conventions

## UML Diagrams
Last updated: March 2024
* [Class Diagram](https://lucid.app/lucidchart/298700bf-4e2e-4c7d-bb06-76365f1efb98/edit?viewport_loc=-7329%2C-1594%2C17982%2C8602%2C0_0&invitationId=inv_11b76774-377e-4967-87a5-c173614a4ef3)
* [Sequence and Use Case Diagrams](https://lucid.app/lucidchart/e774e654-27e9-4168-aee4-39f6f8133738/edit?viewport_loc=-403%2C-342%2C1628%2C779%2C0_0&invitationId=inv_cb3b6cf3-cb84-4091-bd72-88547d50cb3e)

Beneficial in the future:
* package diagram showing the interface exposed to the public
* use case, sequence, and/or activity diagram(s) depicting how this codebase interacts with a calling UI, the different objects instantiated at run-time, the function calls and messages passed between, the synchronous vs asynchronous functioning, etc
* class diagram of the robot and UI code (in their respective repos if not included here)
* deployment model of the whole networked system

See [UML.md](./docs/UML.md) for a UML intro.
